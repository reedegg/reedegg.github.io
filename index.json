When the e-mail flow is examined, it is seen that there is a suspicious Office file. Employees forward the email to the security team for analysis. When L1 analysts scan the suspicious file with several different scanning tools, they see that it does not contain VBA macros. Since the file format is similar to phishing, they forwarded the suspicious Office file to you for detailed analysis. ** Since the 2nd payload download addresses are closed, the 2nd payload is in the zip. Please start your analysis from the Office file.

This type of malware searches for valuable files, such as sensitive documents and configuration files, and encrypts them using a strong encryption algorithm. The investigation has revealed that the ransomware may have used the Windows utility bitsadmin.exe to download additional malicious payloads or communicate with its command-and-control (C2) server. Your task is to carefully review the Sigma rule, answer the related questions, and understand how different rule sections (selection, condition, fields, tags, logsource) work together to detect malicious activity.
