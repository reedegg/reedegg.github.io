## About This Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal cybersecurity blog, built with:

- **Hugo** (static site generator)
- **Blowfish** theme
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages**

The purpose of this site is twofold:

1. Document my learning and technical growth publicly.
2. Demonstrate how I think through investigations, labs, and security problems.
