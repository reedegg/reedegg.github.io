Let\u0026rsquo;s check hybrid-analysis as well to be sure.\nHybrid-Analysis: # Oh, they have the binary outright whitelisted. A quick analysis of the report shows that this is indeed a false positive. Time for the playbook.\nPlaybook: # The alert rule was malware detection; of the options, only \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; fits.\nThe Alert said it was allowed (and it\u0026rsquo;s a false positive\u0026hellip;) but we follow the playbook!\nLog Management: # Filtering by source address and alert date yields a single log.

We\u0026rsquo;re going to follow the playbook the entire time for this alert.\nPlaybook: # We have the answers to most of these questions in our notes:\nMay, 13, 2024, 09:22 AM 103.80.134.63 free@coffeeshooop.com Felix@letsdefend.io We can look in Email Security for the last two questions:\nEmail Security: # Filtering on the phishing email address we quickly find the email; and the answers to the questions:\nYes, it is indeed suspicious. Yes, there is an attachment. Yeah, there was both a URL and an attachment of the same thing: \u0026ldquo;free-coffee.zip\u0026rdquo;\nI would just throw the URL into VirusTotal; however, to avoid hosting actual malware, there is an extra screen that requires confirmation before downloading. So if you are in a security analyst environment where it is safe to be downloading malware, great! If not, this is the SHA-256 hash to follow along: 6f33ae4bf134c49faa14517a275c039ca1818b24fc2304649869e399ab2fb389\nBoth the attachment at the bottom and the big button lead to the file download.\nNote: If you do this in Chrome, it will block it by default.\nVirusTotal: # You can throw either the hash or the zip file into VirusTotal: Yep, indeed malicious. Let\u0026rsquo;s dig into the details to see if we can find C2 IPs to use as IOCs.\nUnder \u0026ldquo;RELATIONS,\u0026rdquo; we can find the Bundled Files, and it looks like the included EXE is known. You can click on that SHA-256 hash to go straight to its report.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dig for C2 IP or hostnames.\nOkay, not using domain names. The \u0026ldquo;Contacted IP addresses\u0026rdquo; list contains many unrelated IPs.\nAh, found it. Under the \u0026ldquo;BEHAVIOR\u0026rdquo; tab, you can find a subcategory of \u0026ldquo;Network Communication\u0026rdquo;, and 37.120.223.226:3451 is the only connection all the sandboxes agree on. We know it\u0026rsquo;s malicious, time to continue the playbook.\nIndeed Malicious.\nWe know this from the Alert details in our notes: It was \u0026ldquo;allowed\u0026rdquo;, which means it was delivered.\nBrief stop over at Email Security.\nBack to playbook!\nAh, I had a feeling that the C2 address would come in handy. Let\u0026rsquo;s check log management.\nLog Management: # The Basic view is good enough; only 4 logs appear when I enter the C2 address.\nYes, the endpoint did indeed contact the C2. Looks like the endpoint is infected. I\u0026rsquo;d like to immediately quarantine the endpoint, but I\u0026rsquo;ll follow the playbook.\nYes, the endpoint is infected.\nOh, good to know my gut was right. Let\u0026rsquo;s head over to Endpoint Security.\nEndpoint Security: # A quick containment, also showing that \u0026ldquo;Coffee.exe\u0026rdquo; is still running.\nContained!\nClean Up: # I attached the IP of the SMTP server being used for Phishing as the Artifact.
